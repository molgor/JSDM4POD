# JSDM4POD
a Joint Species Distribution Model for Presence-Only Data

This repository contains working examples for running (and fitting) the model described in the article:
/A taxonomic-based joint species distribution model for presence-only data/ by Juan Escamilla-Molgora, Luigi Sedda, Peter Diggle and Peter Atkinson in 2020. 


## Installation
The model uses PyStan, Jupyter notebooks and Pandas. 
The best way to run the software is using the Docker container *Biospytial3*

> TODO: include reference to BP3

## Setting up data files
Due to Github policy restrictions on file sizes, some of the data needed are compressed in the folder 'data/'. 
Please unzip these files before.


## Running the case studies
The folder 'notebooks' contains the working examples of case studies 1 and 2.
